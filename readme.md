## Learning how to build a basic blockchain with Python

Following this guide: https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46

## To run:

In project directory run `python Project\ related/FlaskApp.py`

Runs on `http://0.0.0.0:1337`

## Endpoints

[GET] `/mine` - Prompts the program to run the proof of work algorithm, and when it finds the correct proof, claim the reward and add a new block to the chain
[GET] `/chain` - Gets the full chain

### Structure

- `Project related` - Directly related to the blockchain being built
- `Learning tools` - Examples and other sandboxes to demonstrate/learn specific concepts in isolation
